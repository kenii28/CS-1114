NONE TYPE ERROR BECAUSE
reverse() returns nothing
unless it is caught by another variable
#14
[1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6, 7, 8]]
#15
SYNTAX ERROR BECAUSE THERE IS NO INDEX 5
pop only takes the index as a parameter
and when there is no parameter, the last index is taken out
#16
0 because all  the quotes end up being the single quote
#17
[[-2, -2], [1, 3], [7, 6]]
because when you sort a list of lists,
sort() checks the first element of each list within the list
#18
[5,6,7]
[8,9]
[ [1,2,3], [5,6,'A',7], [8,9,'A'] ]
because second is a shallow copy of rirst therefore
it mutates first

#20
bad function name
while doesnt need the ()
qntEntered and sum should be outside of the while loop
otherwise they will constantly be reset.
print doesnt work because you cannot concatenate
str and int
doc string says return but the functions prints to the screen
